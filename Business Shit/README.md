- [Basic Client 'CRM'](https://www.notion.so/0d564a6d825e4fe7895978290f68dde3?v=8426628b83bb4f708ae8ca5ce00d94aa) - I use this to track potential leads before they go into the 'okay sick let's work together' phase. Generally people email and want shit, and I use this to list them and the shit they want.
- [Project Overview](https://www.notion.so/8f19ab435cda4e04a659ac60ee758731?v=87e527a3931b4289aa67a339cc934ce7) - When I decide I want to work with someone, and they wanna work with me, they go into this kind of flow. This is basically to remind me who's signed their contracts, who might need a little nudge, and a general overview of upcoming stuff)
- [Contract](https://www.notion.so/Scott-Riley-Ltd-Contract-a02070de27c74bfcaca01481acb2202b) - This is heavily based on [Ashe Dryden's Open Source contract](https://github.com/ashedryden/freelance-contract)
