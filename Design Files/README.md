# Design Files
Actual pixels on screens and stuff; here's a bunch of various Figma files, some are real projects and if you steal the styles for anything other than learning you're gonna look *very silly*. Feel free to make a copy of any file and pick apart components and styles. Also don't complain about the messiness - these are in-flux real designs not some packaged-up perfect templates. Cool.
