# Documentation
Documenting your problem space, atomic examples/statistical averages of your audience, your system, your design decisions and *every fucking thing else* is a good habit to get in to. Here's some examples from a real project.

## Post-It Lyf
The best kind of documentation involves lashing post-its at a (real or virtual I don't give a fuck) whiteboard. There's a folder of PDFs if you want them, but this list has links to RealtimeBoard projects, which is lush as fuck and deserves your eyes.

## Briefs and Words and Stuff
Design briefs are important and you should be making them. Project plans are good too. They're all words and lists and shit though so *gosh how boring*.
