# Design Process
This is a collection of docs and example deisgn files for pretty much every part of my process. Because it's nice to share.

Feel free to explore the different docs and example files in this repo, but if you *really* want to see how this shit all fits together you should check out the [Notion Amalgamation](https://www.notion.so/Template-Business-Shit-1909311943a6432e95eb352562bbfdc3) of (pretty much) everything I use to track, kick off and manage projects. I'm still filling it up, but half the shit in this repo will either be links to that Notion, exports *from* that Notion, or links to shit that's embedded/linked *in* that Notion.

Huge props to Figma, Notion and RealtimeBoard for being open-enough platforms to allow this kind of sharing.

If you have any questions about this shit, hmu on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scott_riley) where I'm mostly complaining about the fact it's chock full of bad fucking nazis and telling ppl about my baths.

If you use any of this stuff to get/make harmful projects then I hope you fall down the fuckin stairs.
